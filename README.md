Multi-Class Classification App with SVM, Random Forest, and KNN

This Streamlit application demonstrates multi-class classification on popular datasets using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.
Overview

The app provides a user-friendly interface to explore and compare the performance of three different classification algorithms on the following datasets:

    Breast Cancer Dataset
    Iris Dataset
    Wine Dataset

Features

    Dataset Selection: Choose from the available datasets to perform classification.
    Algorithm Selection: Select the desired algorithm (SVM, Random Forest, KNN).
    Parameter Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters for each algorithm to observe changes in performance.
    Visualization: View visualizations of the dataset and classification results.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
